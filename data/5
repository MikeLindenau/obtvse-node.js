{"title":"Codename: Svbtle","content":"\r\n\t\t<p>A couple of months ago, after being irritated by the complexity and uninspiring nature of most blogging platforms, I decided to build my own solution to power <a href=\"http://dcurt.is\">dcurt.is</a>. It is codenamed <a href=\"http://svbtle.com\">Svbtle</a> [1]. The first interface I built just contained a simple list of articles with a “new post” form, like almost every other blogging management system ever created, but it has slowly evolved into something that has hugely improved the quality of my thinking and writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thinking</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the management interface (<a href=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_admin.png\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\">click to enlarge</a>): </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_admin.png\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\">\r\n<img src=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_admin_small.png\">\r\n</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The management interface has evolved to organize posts like my brain does; there are two states: an idea and a published article. When I have an idea, no matter how developed, I throw it into the ideas pane. This creates a physical scrapboard for organizing my thoughts. I work on ideas over time, and, when one of them becomes developed or good enough, I'll publish it and it'll move over into the published column. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This interface doesn't force me into thinking about ideas as posts, like every other blogging system does. I don't have to sit down and think about a title and content, and I'm not expected to publish immediately. The disconnection between draft ideas and published posts makes a big subconscious difference. It allows ideas to start abstractly, to ruminate for a while, and then, as I work on them, to become more and more concrete until they're ready to be published as articles. The side effect of this is that ideas I would never have written down before now become fully developed posts. It has hugely surprised me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Writing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the new post interface (<a href=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_writing_new.png\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\">click to enlarge</a>)  [2]: </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_writing_new.png\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\">\r\n<img src=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_writing_new_small.png\">\r\n</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the editing interface after some amount of writing, showing a post I have been working on for a while that isn't quite ready yet, called The Best   (<a href=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_writing.png\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\">click to enlarge</a>): </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_writing.png\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\">\r\n<img src=\"http://cargo.dcurt.is/svbtle_writing_small.png\">\r\n</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I'm writing, I want to have no distractions, so I removed all of them. When I have control over the visual style of my posts, <a href=\"http://dustincurtis.com\">I tend to take it a bit too far</a>, which hinders the quality of my actual writing and prevents me from publishing. So I removed all styling options; Markdown and some restricted HTML are the only tools for styling posts. One of my main goals for this new writing interface was to encourage myself to spend more time <em>writing</em> and less time presenting. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom bar contains the four main actions I usually want to perform on a post: preview/share, options, status, and the commit button. Hidden under “options” are things like being able to manually specify a permalink and to change the publish date. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Svbtle Network</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than a simple settings area, all of the features of Svbtle are described above. That's it. It really is the essence of blogging; there are no plugins, no post types, and no social bullshit. Each post has one unusual feedback mechanism which has no external repercussions: Kudos (see the right side of each post on any of the network blogs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wrote this engine entirely for myself, without the intention of opening it up to other people. But since realizing that it has improved the way I think and write, I've decided to open it up to a small number of vetted bloggers. At least at first. The goal is simple: when you see the Svbtle design, you should know that the content is <em>guaranteed</em> to be great. Network bloggers are encouraged to keep quality high at the expense of everything else. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Svbtle Network is an experiment that brings some of the best things from newspapers (editing, vetting, etc) to a network of independent bloggers. It is focused on the writing, the news, and the ideas. Everything else is secondary. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check it out: <a href=\"http://svbtle.com\">http://svbtle.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, of course, you should follow me on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dcurtis\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>[1].</strong> I'm having a lot of trouble coming up with a good name/domain. <a href=\"mailto:hi@dustincurtis.com\">Any ideas?</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>[2].</strong>  in general, I don't use this view; I start posts on the manage screen with the quick-add area at the top of the Ideas list.</p>\r\n","date":"2012-03-24T13:27:45.564Z","id":5}
